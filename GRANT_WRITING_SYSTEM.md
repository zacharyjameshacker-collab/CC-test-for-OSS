## CORE PHILOSOPHY

**"Make Each Move Count"** - Every grant pursuit follows systematic patterns that maximize efficiency and success rates.

### Key Principles:
1. **Follow the Funding Guidelines Like Scripture** - They are your North Star
2. **20% Rule** - Only pursue grants with 20%+ success rates
3. **Grant Research Funnel** - Systematic filtering from 100+ to top pursuits
4. **Funding Strategy First** - Plan the entire project funding before writing
5. **Fast and Furious First Drafts** - Speed creates momentum
6. **Always Calculate Match Correctly** - Include all costs in your budget

---

## SEVEN-STEP GRANT WRITING PROCESS

### STEP 1: Follow Your North Star (Funding Guidelines)
- Download, print, and mark up guidelines
- Create comprehensive checklist
- Identify all requirements, deadlines, attachments

### STEP 2: Prepare Your Narrative Skeleton
- Outline every section before writing
- Map guideline requirements to outline
- Identify which sections need supporting data

### STEP 3: Host an Outstanding Kick-Off Meeting
- Assemble project team
- Assign responsibilities
- Establish timeline with buffer days
- Create shared project folder structure

### STEP 4: Finalize the Grant Budget
- Use standardized budget template (SF-424A format)
- Get vendor quotes (add 3-5% inflation buffer)
- Calculate match correctly (cost share must appear in main budget)
- Verify indirect costs are allowable

### STEP 5: Write Your Narrative Fast and Furiously
- Set 25-minute focused writing sprints
- Write terribly on purpose (first draft speed)
- Don't edit while writing
- Complete sections in priority order

### STEP 6: Prep Your Key Attachments
- Letters of support (request 4-6 weeks early)
- Organizational documents (501c3, bylaws, etc.)
- Resumes/CVs for key personnel
- Data/statistics supporting need

### STEP 7: Independent Review and Submit
- Have someone unfamiliar review for clarity
- Run spell check
- Submit 24-48 hours before deadline
- Save confirmation emails

## GRANT RESEARCH FUNNEL

### STAGE 1: Find 100+ Grants (Broad Search)
**Tools:** Instrumentl, Candid, GrantStation, federal databases
**Filters:**
- Organization type alignment
- General mission/field alignment
- Geographic eligibility
**Goal:** Generate initial prospect list

### STAGE 2: From 100+ to ~20 Worth Evaluating (Quick Filtering)
**Three Critical Filters:**

1. **Funder's Giving Priorities**
   - Natural alignment test (no stretching)
   - Mission/language alignment
   
2. **Eligible Use of Funds**
   - Confirm project type is eligible
   - Check for excluded expenses
   
3. **Funding History (990 Forms for Foundations)**
   - Total giving ($1M+ annually preferred)
   - Geographic distribution
   - Past giving to similar organizations/projects

**Speed:** Move quickly - this is "keep or cut" decisions, not final analysis

### STAGE 3: From ~20 to Top Pursuits (Deep Evaluation)
**Four-Step Process:**

**STEP 1: Calculate Competitiveness**
- Formula: Awards Made ÷ Total Applicants = Success %
- Target: 20%+ success rate
- Email funders directly to get this data

**STEP 2: Read Funding Guidelines**
- Deep dive into requirements
- Assess complexity vs. reward
- Note all deadlines and prerequisites

**STEP 3: Contact Past Applicants**
- Request copies of successful applications
- Ask about reporting requirements
- Learn funding strategy for remaining project costs

**STEP 4: Contact the Funder**
- Send one-page project prospectus first
- Ask strategic questions (see knowledge base)
- Confirm eligibility explicitly
- Request honest feedback on fit

**Timeline:** 2-8 weeks depending on project complexity

## BUDGET PREPARATION SYSTEM

### Budget Categories (SF-424A Format):

1. **Personnel**
   - Position titles (not names)
   - Hours calculation: hours/week × weeks
   - Actual hourly rates from payroll

2. **Fringe Benefits**
   - 10-30% of personnel costs
   - Get organizational rate from accounting
   - May vary by employee level

3. **Travel**
   - Use GSA per diem rates
   - Add 3-5% inflation buffer per year
   - Include: lodging, transport, meals, incidentals

4. **Equipment** (>$5,000, >1 year useful life)
   - Get vendor quotes
   - Add 3-5% inflation buffer
   - Save quotes in project folder

5. **Supplies** (<$5,000 or consumable)
   - Itemize major supplies
   - Get quotes when possible

6. **Contractual**
   - Sub-recipients, vendors, contractors
   - Save all cost estimates
   - Examples: evaluators, consultants

7. **Construction**
   - New construction or renovation costs
   - Architectural/engineering fees
   - Permits and inspections

8. **Other Direct Costs**
   - Anything not fitting above categories
   - Communications, printing, postage
   - Space rental for project activities

9. **Indirect Costs**
   - Organizational overhead rate
   - Check if allowed in guidelines
   - Affects total funding needed calculation

10. **Cost Share/Match**
    - Must also appear in main budget categories
    - Calculate: Cost Share ÷ Total Project Costs = %
    - Types: Cash, in-kind, personnel time

**CRITICAL:** If match is in cost share column, it MUST be in the total budget elsewhere!

---

## NARRATIVE WRITING TECHNIQUES

### Fast and Furious Method:

2. **Write terribly on purpose** - edit later
3. **Minimum word counts** - focus on quantity first
