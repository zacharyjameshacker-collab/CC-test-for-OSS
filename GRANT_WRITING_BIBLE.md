## The 6-Step Grant Writing Process

### STEP 1: Read and Understand the Guidelines

**The Rule:** Read the complete guidelines twice before doing anything else.

**First Read:** Get the big picture
- Skim through quickly
- Don't try to memorize
- Let your brain make initial connections
- Take a break (pet your dog, get coffee, stretch)

**Second Read:** Deep analysis
- Highlight keywords that appear repeatedly
- Note specific instructions (font size, margins, etc.)
- Identify all narrative questions/prompts
- Extract scoring criteria and point values
- Flag required attachments
- Mark all deadlines
- Note eligibility requirements
- Identify match requirements
- Look for restrictions/limitations
- Understand evaluation process

**Complexity Variations:**
- Federal grants: 80+ pages common
- Simple applications: 2 pages possible
- Complexity usually correlates with award size

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Unrealistic timelines
- Excessive match requirements
- Unclear eligibility
- Poor funder reputation
- Restrictions that don't fit your project

**Key Principle:** The funding guidelines are your "North Star" - return to them constantly throughout the process.

---

### STEP 2: Prepare Your Narrative Skeleton

**Purpose:** Create an outline that eliminates the intimidation of a blank page.

**Process:**
1. Open a blank document
2. Type each narrative prompt/question exactly as written in guidelines
3. Format as headers and subheaders matching funder's structure
4. Add scoring criteria under each section (if provided)
5. Add bullet points for brainstorming (NO COMPLETE SENTENCES!)
6. Flag information gaps and questions
7. Identify who has needed information

**Example Structure:**
```
Rating Factor 1: Capacity of the Applicant (25 points)

Subfactor 1.1.a Managerial and Technical Staff
Describe the project-specific roles and responsibilities and knowledge/
experience of the project director and all individual key staff...

Scoring Criteria:
- Roles/responsibilities clearly defined (5 points)
- Experience is relevant, recent, and successful (10 points)
- Past projects completed on/ahead of schedule (10 points)

BRAINSTORMING BULLETS:
• Need Project Director resume
• Get Sarah's examples of past projects
• Confirm John's last 5 years experience
• Emphasize the XYZ project - finished early!

QUESTIONS FOR KICKOFF:
- Who will be officially named as Project Director?
- What projects best demonstrate our track record?
```

**Why No Complete Sentences Yet?**
- You don't have all the information
- You'll waste time rewriting
- Bullets help identify gaps faster
- Easier to collaborate with team

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Starting to write full narrative too early
- Not including scoring criteria
- Skipping the brainstorming bullets
- Trying to do this without guidelines in front of you

---

### STEP 3: Host an Outstanding Kick-Off Meeting

**Purpose:** Get team buy-in, assign responsibilities, and establish timeline.

**The Success Formula:** 
The amount of help you receive during grant writing is directly correlated to the success of your kick-off meeting.

**Meeting Preparation:**

**1. Bring Appreciation**
- In-person: Cookies, lunch, snacks
- Remote: Coffee/pastries delivery before call
- People who feel appreciated make your requests a priority

**2. Prepare Agenda** (send 1 day in advance)
**Required Elements:**
- Date, time, host, attendees
- RE: Kick Off Meeting for [Grant Name] Application
- Introductions (if needed)
- Objective statement
- Project overview
- Questions list
- Narrative skeleton review
- Responsibility assignments
- Schedule discussion
- Wrap-up (next meeting date/time)

**3. Distribute Materials in Advance**
- Meeting agenda
- Narrative skeleton
- Project overview (if available)
- Budget estimate (if available)

**Meeting Flow:**

**Introduction & Objective (5 minutes)**
- Brief intros if needed
- State objective: "We're here to agree on how to share responsibilities for the [Grant Name] application."

**Project Overview (10 minutes)**
- Confirm agreement on project scope
- Verify alignment with grant opportunity
- Address any scope questions

**Questions Session (15 minutes)**
- Go through your questions list
- Capture answers and action items
- Identify who has missing information

**Narrative Skeleton Review (20 minutes)**
- Walk through section by section
- Identify information sources for each section
- Assign responsibilities
- Flag sections needing external input

**Example Assignments:**
- Narrative: Lisa (lead), Meredith (support)
- SF-424 Form: Lisa
- Budget: Meredith
- Implementation Schedule: Meredith
- Resolution: Lisa prepares, Andrea gets passed
- Letters of Support: Lisa coordinates

**Schedule Discussion (10 minutes)**
- Review timeline (work backward from deadline)
- Identify vacation/unavailability
- Set progress meeting schedule
- Establish internal review deadlines

**Wrap-Up (5 minutes)**
- Summarize action items
- Confirm next meeting
- Express appreciation

**Post-Meeting Actions:**
- Send summary email within 24 hours
- Include action items with responsible parties
- Add calendar invites for progress meetings
- Share meeting notes and updated skeleton

**Progress Meeting Schedule:**
- Weekly meetings, same day/time
- 30-40 minutes maximum
- Standing agenda: progress, challenges, next steps
- Action items assigned at end

**The Power of Short Meetings:**
Shorter meetings = refreshed attendees = immediate action on tasks

---

### STEP 4: Finalize the Grant Budget

**Critical Principle:** Everything depends on the budget. Finish it FIRST.

**Why Budget is Priority #1:**

1. **Match Calculation** - Can't calculate 50% match without total project cost
2. **Match Documentation** - Resolutions take time to get approved
3. **Budget Narrative** - Can't write justification without complete budget
4. **Impact Numbers** - Budget determines how many people you can serve
5. **Implementation Plan** - Budget affects scope, timeline, and deliverables
6. **Narrative Writing** - Budget details needed throughout narrative

**Budget Development Process:**

**1. Create "Base Camp" Budget**
- Complete project budget for all sources
- Include ALL costs (not just grant-funded portions)
- Document assumptions
- Get quotes where possible
- Include contingencies

**2. Identify Funding Sources**
- Grant request amount
- Match requirements (cash and in-kind)
- Other committed funds
- Pending funds
- Gap funding needed

**3. Calculate Match Strategy**
- Cash match sources
- In-kind match sources
- Document all contributions
- Get commitment letters if needed

**4. Format for Funder Requirements**
- Use funder's budget template if provided
- Adapt base camp budget to their categories
- Some categories don't align perfectly - ask if confused
- Maintain own detailed budget separately

**5. Document Budget Narrative**
- How costs were estimated
- Why each expense is necessary
- How quotes were obtained
- Explanation of calculations
- Justification of rates/prices

**Budget Categories (typical):**
- Personnel (salaries/wages)
- Fringe Benefits
- Travel
- Equipment
- Supplies
- Contractual
- Construction/Renovation
- Other Direct Costs
- Indirect Costs

**Common Budget Mistakes:**
- Forgetting fringe benefits
- Underestimating indirect costs
- Not documenting assumptions
- Mixing restricted and unrestricted funds
- Ignoring funder's cost limitations
- Not planning for contingencies

**Budget Best Practices:**
- Get multiple quotes for major expenses
- Use current salary data
- Include cost escalation for multi-year projects
- Be conservative in estimates
- Document EVERYTHING
- Cross-reference with narrative
- Have finance person review

**The Budget Formula:**
```
Total Project Cost
- Grant Request
- Cash Match
- In-Kind Match
- Other Secured Funds
= Funding Gap
```

---

### STEP 5: Write Your Narrative Fast and Furiously

**The Goal:** Complete first draft as fast as possible, then edit extensively.

**Timeline Targets:**
- **Simple online forms** (<500 characters per response): 4 days or less
- **Complex proposals** (18-20 pages): 8 days or less (ideally faster)

**The Fast Writing Strategy:**

**1. Write Backward**
- Start with hardest sections (typically end of narrative)
- Harder sections: budgeting, project feasibility, evaluation
- Easier sections: project description, organization background
- Writing hard sections first makes beginning sections easier

**2. Use XX% Placeholders**
- DON'T STOP TO LOOK UP DATA
- Write: "XX% of project beneficiaries are low to moderate income"
- Go back later to fill in exact statistics
- Prevents context switching

**3. Minimize Context Switching**
**The Research on Context Switching:**
- Average person switches tasks every 3 minutes (Gloria Mark, UC Irvine)
- Context switching costs up to 80% of productivity (Gerald Weinberg)
- Each switch requires 15-20 minutes to regain focus

**How to Avoid Context Switching:**
- Close email
- Silence phone
- Use website blockers
- Work in dedicated writing blocks (minimum 90 minutes)
- Use XX% placeholders instead of researching mid-sentence
- Batch all research for separate session
- Schedule specific "research time"

**4. Use Accountability Buddy**
- Find someone to receive your drafts every 2-3 days
- They don't need to read early drafts
- Just accepting drafts creates accountability
- Keeps you on schedule
- Can be within organization or trusted friend
- Offer to reciprocate

**5. Audio-to-Text Hack**
- Record yourself talking through each section
- Use narrative skeleton as guide
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Use transcription service to convert to text
- Edit transcript instead of writing from scratch
- Saves hours of writing time

**6. Collaborate Smart**
- Establish who reviews what sections
- Set specific review deadlines
- Use track changes for feedback
- Address feedback in batches
- Don't send for review too early

**7. Edit Extensively**
- Minimum 4 drafts after first complete draft
- Complex federal grants: 15+ drafts common
- Each edit increases clarity and conciseness
- Great writing is concise and clear
- Remove unnecessary words ruthlessly
- Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing

**The Editing Process:**
- **Draft 1:** Get all content down (rough!)
- **Draft 2:** Fill in XX% placeholders
- **Draft 3:** Strengthen arguments and evidence
- **Draft 4:** Tighten language and cut excess
- **Draft 5+:** Polish and perfect

---

### STEP 6: Prep Your Key Attachments

**Timing:** Start attachments after kick-off meeting, parallel with narrative writing.

**Common Attachments:**

**1. Budget and Budget Narrative**
- Adapted from base camp budget
- Formatted per funder requirements
- Detailed narrative justification
- Cross-referenced with project narrative
- All calculations documented

**2. Resolution**
- Approval from governing body
- Board of directors (nonprofits)
- Tribal/city council (government entities)
- Required specific language (check guidelines)

- Authorized signatories

**Timeline Challenge:**
- Boards typically meet monthly
- Need to get on agenda early
- Allow 3-4 weeks minimum
- Coordinate with clerk/board secretary
- Follow their submission process

**3. Letters of Support**
**Purpose:**
- Demonstrate community/partner support

- Establish partnerships
- Commit specific resources
- Build reviewer confidence

**How to Get Great Letters:**
- Provide template or talking points
- Make it EASY for letter writer
- Give specific requests

## The Grant Research Funnel

### Overview

The Grant Research Funnel is a systematic, three-stage process for identifying the best grant opportunities. It prevents "shotgunning" applications and dramatically improves success rates.

**The Three Stages:**
1. **Stage 1:** 100+ grants identified
2. **Stage 2:** Filter to ~20 worth evaluating
3. **Stage 3:** Narrow to top 3-5 to pursue

### Why This Matters

**Federal Grant Statistics:**
- $721 billion distributed in 2019 (16% of federal budget)
- 900 federal grant programs
- 26 different agencies
- Health grants now 60% of federal giving (was 30% in 1989)

**Foundation Statistics:**
- $75.7 billion in foundation giving (2019)
- 17% of total U.S. giving
- 20% of nonprofit income from grants

**The Problem:**
Without systematic research, organizations chase grants randomly, waste resources, and experience low success rates and burnout.

**The Solution:**
The Grant Research Funnel provides a logical, repeatable process for finding the right grants.

---

### Stage 1: Find 100+ Grants

**Goal:** Cast wide net using grant database

**Process:**

**1. Choose Your Database**
- **Instrumentl** (Recommended) - www.instrumentl.com/lgw
- **Candid** (formerly Foundation Directory)
- **Grants.gov** (Federal only)
- **State-specific databases**
- **Grantmakers.io** (Free 990 data)

**2. Set Up Search Parameters**
- **Organization Type** - Check multiple boxes!
  - Your organization type
  - Potential partner types
  - Fiscal sponsor if applicable
- **Keywords** - Project focus areas
- **Location** - Geographic eligibility
- **Award Size** - Realistic for your capacity
- **Funder Type** - Government, foundation, corporate

**3. Consider Partnerships**
Partnering expands opportunities:
- Nonprofit + University = Research grants
- Nonprofit + Government = Community development grants
- Nonprofit + Healthcare = Health equity grants
- Multiple nonprofits = Collective impact grants

**4. Export Results**
- Generate list of 100+ opportunities
- Export to funding matrix template
- Include: funder name, amount, deadline, focus area, eligibility

**Target:** 100-150 grants
- Less than 100: Broaden search
- More than 150: Narrow parameters (increase minimum award, fewer keywords)

**Time Investment:** 10 minutes with Instrumentl, 10-20 hours manual searching

---

### Stage 2: From 100+ to ~20 Worth Evaluating

**Goal:** Quick "keep or cut" decisions based on three filters

**The Three Filters:**

**Filter 1: Funder's Giving Priorities**
- Review funder overview/mission
- Look for natural alignment
- Don't try to force-fit your project
- Language should resonate
- If it feels like a stretch, cut it!

**Questions:**
- Does the funder's language align with our mission?
- Do they fund organizations like ours?
- Is our project a genuine fit?

**Filter 2: Eligible Use of Funds**
- Confirm your project is allowable expense
- Common ineligible items:
  - Capital improvements (sometimes)
  - General operating (often)
  - Conferences/meetings
  - Endowments
  - Fundraising activities
  - Ongoing operational costs

**Questions:**
- Is our specific project type eligible?
- Are our budget categories allowable?
- Any restrictions that exclude us?

**Filter 3: Funding History**
**Best indicator of future giving is past giving**

**For Government/State Grants:**
- Check agency website for past awardees
- Look at funded project descriptions
- Note geographic distribution
- Check average award sizes
- Identify patterns in funded projects

**For Foundation Grants:**
Use 990 forms to find:

**Total Giving:**
- Annual giving amount
- Average award size
- Typically want $1M+ per year minimum
- Consider geography and focus

**Geography:**
- Where do they actually give?
- May say "nationwide" but only fund in NY
- Look at recipient locations
- Eliminate if no history in your area

**Giving History:**
- What types of organizations funded?
- What issues supported?
- Similar projects to yours?
- Organization size/budget patterns?

**Where to Find 990s:**
- Instrumentl (if subscribed)
- Candid
- Public library
- Grantmakers.io (FREE!)

**The Quick Decision Process:**
1. Read funder overview (2 minutes)
2. Check eligibility (2 minutes)
3. Review 990 or past awards (5 minutes)
4. Decide: KEEP or CUT (1 minute)

**Total time per grant:** ~10 minutes maximum

**Critical Principle:** Move FAST at this stage. You're not making final decisions, just winnowing the list.

**Invite-Only Funders:**
- Generally cut from list
- But if superb fit, keep with asterisk
- Strategies for getting invited covered in Stage 3

**Output:** ~20 grants worth deeper evaluation

---

### Stage 3: From ~20 to Top 3-5 to Pursue

**Goal:** Deep evaluation to identify best opportunities

**The Seven Evaluation Criteria:**

**1. Competitiveness (Most Important)**

**Calculation:**
```
Success Rate = (Number of Awards / Number of Applicants) × 100
```

**Target:** 20% or higher
- Acceptable: 13-15% with strong justification
- Poor: Below 13%

**How to Get Numbers:**
- Call/email program officer
- Review past program reports
- Check agency data
- FOIA request if needed
- Estimate based on award amounts

**Example:**
- 100 applicants
- 24 awards made
- 24% success rate = GOOD

**Why This Matters:**
- 1-2% success rate = waste of time
- 20%+ = reasonable odds
- Affects ROI calculation

**2. Organizational Alignment**

**Deep Dive Questions:**
- Mission alignment?
- Values alignment?
- Geographic fit?
- Organization size appropriate?
- Project type matches funded work?
- Issue area perfect fit?
- Population served matches?

**Red Flags:**
- Mission mismatch
- Wrong geographic focus
- Organization too small/large
- Issue area tangential
- Population not priority

**3. Project Readiness**

**Assessment:**
- Can project start on required timeline?
- Do you have capacity to deliver?
- Are partners committed?
- Permits/approvals obtainable?
- Project design complete enough?
- Community support established?

**Readiness Levels:**
- **Ready Now:** Shovel-ready, can start immediately
- **Nearly Ready:** Minor details to finalize
- **Needs Work:** Significant planning remaining
- **Not Ready:** Concept stage only

**Only pursue if Ready Now or Nearly Ready**

**4. Match Requirements**

**Types of Match:**
- Cash match (hardest to secure)
- In-kind match (services, volunteer time, donated goods)
- Soft match (other grants, revenues)

**Questions:**
- What percentage required?
- Cash or in-kind acceptable?
- Timing of match (can be post-award)
- Sources of match identified?
- Commitments secured?
- Documentation available?

**Match Strategy:**
- Identify all possible sources
- Get commitment letters
- Document in-kind values
- Leverage other grants
- Don't overcommit organization resources

**5. Restrictions**

**Review Carefully:**
- Equipment purchases allowed/required?
- Salary caps?
- Indirect cost limitations?
- Time restrictions?
- Geographic limitations?
- Procurement requirements?
- Reporting burden?
- Audit requirements?

**Dealbreakers:**
- Can't meet match requirement
- Project ineligible
- Timeline impossible
- Restrictions conflict with org policies
- Reporting burden too high
- Risk too great

**6. Award Size vs. Effort**

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Estimated Hours × Hourly Rate (+ benefits) = Preparation Cost
Award Amount - Preparation Cost = Net Benefit
Net Benefit × Success Rate = Expected Value
```

**Example:**
- 60 hours × $50/hr = $3,000 cost
- $50,000 award - $3,000 = $47,000 net
- $47,000 × 25% success rate = $11,750 expected value

**Decision:**
- Positive expected value = Consider
- Negative expected value = Don't pursue

**Also Consider:**
- Non-financial benefits
- Relationship building
- Learning opportunity
- Strategic positioning

**7. Timeline Feasibility**

**Reality Check:**
- Days until deadline?
- Other grant deadlines?
- Team capacity?
- Key staff availability?
- Board meeting schedule?
- Partner availability?

**Minimum Timelines:**
- Simple application: 2-3 weeks
- Moderate complexity: 4-6 weeks
- Complex federal: 8-12 weeks

**Red Flags:**
- Deadline too soon
- Conflicts with other priorities
- Key people unavailable
- Board meeting timing bad

**Contacting the Funder**

**When to Reach Out:**
- Before announcement (ideal)
- Early in application period
- Never last week before deadline

**What to Ask:**
1. Eligibility confirmation
2. Project fit assessment
3. Past award information
4. Application process tips
5. Evaluation criteria clarification
6. Partnership requirements
7. Match flexibility
8. Timeline questions

**How to Approach:**
- Email first (less intrusive)
- Phone follow-up if no response
- Send project overview in advance
- Prepare specific questions
- Take detailed notes
- Follow up with thank you
- Build relationship over time

**Prepare Project Overview:**
- One-page prospectus
- Organization background
- Project description
- Community need
- Project impact

- Send before meeting/call
- Shows preparation and respect
- Enables substantive conversation
- Makes you stand out

**5. Multi-Year Relationship Building**
- Attend their events
- Follow on social media
- Comment on their work
- Apply to smaller opportunities first
- Be patient and persistent

**Final Evaluation:**

Create scoring matrix (1-5 scale):
- Competitiveness (weight 3x)
- Organizational alignment (weight 2x)
- Project readiness (weight 2x)
- Match feasibility (weight 2x)
- No dealbreaker restrictions
- Positive ROI
- Timeline feasible

**Total weighted score determines ranking**

**Output:** Top 3-5 grants to pursue, ranked with justifications

## Persuasive Narrative Writing

### The Seven Tips for Convincing Writing

**TIP 1: Know Why You Believe in the Project**
- You must genuinely believe in it
- Describe with passion to friends/family
- Like sales - hard to sell if you don't believe
- Only take on projects you find important
- Life too short for projects that don't speak to heart

**Write It Down:**
Why this project is important to you personally

**TIP 2: Establish the Need (with Urgency)**
- Use "catastrophic" when appropriate
- Establish dire need for funding
- Create urgency - can't wait another year
- Not just presenting facts - persuading
- Move your reader
- Tell stories for context
- Show them why, not just what

**Example (EPA Brownfields):**
"The former 4th Avenue Theater in Downtown is a cherished historical icon but rapidly deteriorating. It has numerous code deficiencies, asbestos, and a petroleum release from an underground storage tank."

**TIP 3: Paint a Vivid Picture**
- Use sensory details
- Include specific examples
- Tell stories about real people
- Make reviewer see and feel the need
- Bring community to life

**TIP 4: Know Your Reviewer**
- Reading dozens of applications
- Often tired
- Looking for reasons to score high or low
- Make their job easy
- Clear, concise writing wins

**TIP 5: Support Claims with Data**
- Every claim needs evidence
- Use recent statistics
- Cite credible sources
- Integrate data naturally
- Don't just list numbers

**TIP 6: Be Excessively Clear**
- Answer every question explicitly
- Use their exact language
- Create subheaders for each question
- Make scoring easy for reviewer
- No reviewer should have to search for answer

**Example Structure:**
```
Rating Factor 3: Project Need (30 points)

Subfactor 3.a: Community Need
[Clear answer to question A]

Subfactor 3.b: Project Impact  
[Clear answer to question B]

Subfactor 3.c: Urgency
[Clear answer to question C]

**TIP 7: Balance Deficit and Strengths**

**Deficit-Based Approach:**
- Focuses on what's broken
- Emphasizes negative statistics
- Can reinforce stereotypes
- Treats people as objects of charity
- "Us versus them" mentality

**Strengths-Based Approach:**
- Sees people as the answer
- "In this together" mentality
- Increases sustainability
- Focuses on what's working

**The Balance:** 20% deficit-based, 80% strengths-based

**Comparison:**
| Deficit-Based | Strengths-Based |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Implement programs as answer | See people as answer |
| Us versus them | In this together |
| Assumes dependence | Increases sustainability |
| Focus on what's broken | Focus on what's working |

### Additional Writing Principles

**Show Don't Tell:**
- Use specific examples
- Include quotes from community
- Describe concrete actions
- Paint visual pictures

**Active Voice:**
- "We will serve 200 families" vs. "200 families will be served"
- More direct and powerful
- Easier to read

**Concise Language:**
- Every word should earn its place
- Remove unnecessary adjectives
- Cut redundant phrases
- Respect word limits

**Consistent Terminology:**
- Use funder's language
- Define acronyms first use
- Maintain consistent names for elements
- Don't switch terms mid-narrative

**Transitions:**
- Connect sections logically

- Reinforce main themes

**Formatting:**
- Use headers/subheaders
- White space for readability
- Bold key points sparingly
- Bullet points when appropriate
- Tables for data presentation

## Budget Development

### Budget Principles

**1. Budget is the Foundation**
- Impacts every part of application
- Must be complete before narrative
- Everything depends on accurate budget
- Changes ripple through entire application

**2. Document Everything**
- How costs were estimated
- Quotes obtained
- Assumptions made
- Calculation methodologies
- All sources of information

**3. Be Conservative**
- Better to overestimate costs
- Include contingencies
- Don't lowball to look better
- Funder wants realistic budget

**4. Cross-Reference with Narrative**
- Budget must match narrative description
- Numbers should align perfectly
- Inconsistencies raise red flags
- Review together at end

### Budget Categories

**Personnel:**
- Salaries/wages
- Position titles
- % time on project
- Hourly rates or annual salary
- Number of hours/months
- Justification of need

**Calculation Example:**
```
Project Director: $75,000 annual salary × 25% time = $18,750/year
Grant Writer: $35/hour × 10 hours/month × 12 months = $4,200
```

**Fringe Benefits:**
- Health insurance
- Retirement contributions
- Payroll taxes
- Workers compensation
- Other benefits
- Usually 25-35% of salary

**Calculation:**
```
Total Personnel: $22,950
Fringe Rate: 28%
Fringe Benefits: $22,950 × 0.28 = $6,426
```

**Travel:**
- Purpose of each trip
- Destination
- Number of travelers
- Number of trips
- Cost breakdown:
  - Airfare
  - Ground transportation
  - Lodging (per diem rate)
  - Meals (per diem rate)
  - Registration fees

**Example:**
```
Conference Attendance (2 staff):
Airfare: $500 × 2 = $1,000
Hotel: $150/night × 3 nights × 2 = $900
Meals: $55/day × 3 days × 2 = $330
Ground transport: $100 × 2 = $200
Registration: $400 × 2 = $800
TOTAL: $3,230
```

**Equipment:**
- Items over $5,000 (typically)
- Permanent nature
- Required for project
- Quotes required
- Useful life justification
- Limited or prohibited by some funders

**Supplies:**
- Consumable items
- Under equipment threshold
- Office supplies
- Project materials
- Software licenses
- Itemized or categorized

**Contractual:**
- Consultant services
- Professional services
- Scope of work
- Procurement method
- Cost justification
- Why can't be done in-house

**Construction/Renovation:**
- Detailed scope of work
- Architect/engineer estimates
- Multiple bids
- Permits and inspections
- Contingency (typically 10%)
- Timeline
- Often requires environmental review

**Other Direct Costs:**
- Items not fitting other categories
- Printing/copying
- Postage
- Communications
- Insurance
- Evaluation costs
- Audit costs

**Indirect Costs (Overhead):**
- Administrative costs
- Facilities
- Utilities
- General management
- Calculated as % of total direct costs
- Based on federally negotiated rate (if have one)
- De minimis rate: 10% of MTDC (if no negotiated rate)

**Calculation:**
```
Total Modified Direct Costs: $100,000
Indirect Rate: 15%
Indirect Costs: $100,000 × 0.15 = $15,000
```

### Match/Cost Share

**Types:**
- **Cash Match** - Actual money spent
- **In-Kind Match** - Donated goods/services
- **Hard Match** - Required by funder
- **Soft Match** - Optional but strengthens application

**In-Kind Valuation:**
- Volunteer time: Standard hourly rate for position
- Donated space: Fair market rental value
- Donated equipment: Fair market value or depreciated value
- Donated services: Professional rate
- Donated goods: Purchase price or fair market value

**Documentation Required:**
- Value calculation methodology
- Commitment letters
- Board authorization
- Tracking system
- Audit requirements

**Match Strategy:**
- Identify all possible sources
- Leverage across multiple grants
- Time match appropriately
- Don't overcommit
- Maintain reserve

### Budget Narrative

**Purpose:**
Explain how you arrived at each budget number

**Format:**
Organize by budget category with subheaders

**What to Include:**
- Specific calculations
- Rationale for need
- How quotes obtained
- Assumptions made
- Links to narrative activities

**Example:**
```
PERSONNEL
Project Director (Jane Smith): The Project Director will oversee all
project activities, supervise staff, manage budget, and ensure
compliance with grant requirements. Ms. Smith's current annual salary
is $75,000. She will dedicate 25% of her time (10 hours per week) to
this project over the 24-month grant period. Total cost: $18,750 per
year × 2 years = $37,500.
```

## Evaluation & Impact

### Why Evaluation Matters

**For Funders:**
- Accountability for investment
- Evidence of impact
- Learning what works
- Justification for continued funding

**For Your Organization:**
- Improves program quality
- Demonstrates value
- Informs decisions
- Builds credibility
- Supports future funding

**For Community:**
- Ensures effective services
- Maximizes benefit
- Respects their time/participation
- Creates feedback loop

### Types of Evaluation

**Process Evaluation (Implementation):**
- Are activities happening as planned?
- Is timeline on track?
- Are resources used appropriately?
- Are participants engaged?
- What adjustments needed?

**Output Evaluation (Quantity):**
- How many people served?
- How many services delivered?
- How many events held?
- How many materials distributed?

**Outcome Evaluation (Quality):**
- What changed for participants?
- Did knowledge increase?
- Did skills improve?
- Did behaviors change?
- Did conditions improve?

**Impact Evaluation (Long-term):**
- What lasting changes occurred?
- Did community conditions improve?
- Were systems changed?
- What happened after project ended?

### Logic Model

**Components:**
1. **Inputs** - Resources invested
2. **Activities** - What you do
3. **Outputs** - Direct products
4. **Outcomes** - Changes that result
5. **Impact** - Long-term change

**Example:**
```
Inputs: Staff, funding, facility
  ↓
Activities: Job training classes
  ↓
Outputs: 100 people complete training
  ↓
Short-term Outcomes: Improved job skills
  ↓
Medium-term Outcomes: 70% gain employment
  ↓
Long-term Impact: Reduced community unemployment
```

### Evaluation Plan

**What to Include:**

**1. Evaluation Questions**

### SMART Outcomes

**S** - Specific (clearly defined)  
**M** - Measurable (quantifiable)  
**A** - Achievable (realistic)  
**R** - Relevant (aligned with goals)  
**T** - Time-bound (deadline specified)

**Example:**
❌ Poor: "Improve youth education"

✅ Good: "By end of Year 1, 80% of program participants will improve math scores by at least one grade level as measured by standardized assessment"

### Common Mistakes

- Confusing outputs with outcomes
- Setting unmeasurable goals
- Overpromising results
- Ignoring baseline data
- Not planning for evaluation costs
- Collecting data but not using it

- Close email
- Silence phone
- Use website blockers
- Physical sign: "Do Not Disturb"

**3. Batch Similar Tasks**
- All budget calculations together
- All funder outreach together
- All editing together
- All research together

**4. Use Accountability Systems**
- Accountability buddy
- Progress meetings
- Deadlines for drafts
- Shared calendars

**5. Protect Your Energy**
- Tackle hardest work when fresh
- Take breaks
- Move your body
- Change locations
- Celebrate small wins

- "I just got lucky"
- "Someone will find out I don't know what I'm doing"
- "Everyone else is better than me"
- "I don't have enough experience"

### The Truth

- Grant writing is learnable (not innate talent)
- Everyone starts somewhere
- Your unique perspective is valuable
- Past experience translates
- Mistakes are learning opportunities

### Combating Imposter Syndrome

**1. Document Your Wins**
- Keep success journal
- Save compliments
- Track funded grants
- Note skills learned

**2. Focus on Learning**
- Growth mindset
- Every application teaches something
- Seek feedback
- Invest in education

**3. Find Your Community**
- Connect with other grant writers
- Share struggles
- Learn you're not alone
- Support each other

**4. Reframe Thoughts**
- "I'm not qualified" → "I'm learning"
- "I made a mistake" → "I learned something"
- "They'll find out" → "I'm developing expertise"

**5. Celebrate Progress**
- Notice how far you've come
- Acknowledge small wins
- Be kind to yourself
- Progress over perfection
