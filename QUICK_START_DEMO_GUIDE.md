## PREPARATION FOR YOUR DEMO

### 1. KEY TALKING POINTS

**Opening Statement:**
"I've built an automated grant writing system using Claude Code that will increase our capacity by 85% while improving quality and client satisfaction. Let me show you how it works."

**The Problem:**
- Grant writing currently takes 40-60 hours per project
- Quality varies by writer

**The Solution:**
- Systematic 3-stage research process (100+ → Top 5)
- Automated budget generation with validation
- Professional funding strategies for clients
- Fast writing sprints that eliminate writer's block
- Built-in quality assurance

**The Results:**
- 37 hours saved per grant
- 85% capacity increase (20 grants → 37 grants/year)
- $55,500 in additional capacity annually
- Higher success rates
- Better client satisfaction

### 3. ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: "How much does this cost?"**
A: "Claude Code is included with Claude Pro subscription ($20/month). The real investment is 20 hours of setup time, which pays back after the first grant."

**Q: "Will the team actually use it?"**
A: "Yes, because it makes their lives easier. Writers get past writer's block, budgets are less stressful, and we have consistent quality. Plus, we'll train everyone."

**Q: "What if Claude Code changes or stops working?"**
A: "The system is based on Meredith Noble's methodology, which works with or without Claude Code. The automation just makes us faster. But Claude Code is Anthropic's product and actively maintained."

**Q: "How long to implement?"**
A: "8-week rollout: 1 week setup, 2 weeks pilot, 1 week team training, 4 weeks full deployment. We can start seeing results in Week 3."

**Q: "Can we customize it?"**
A: "Absolutely. I built it specifically for One Small Step's needs, especially our commercial fishing clients. We can add more specializations."

**Q: "What about client data security?"**
A: "All files stay on our systems. Claude Code runs locally. No client data goes to Anthropic servers."

**Q: "How do we measure success?"**
A: "We'll track time savings, success rates, client satisfaction, and capacity increase. I've built analytics into the system."

**Q: "What's the risk if it doesn't work?"**
A: "Minimal. We can pilot with 2 projects first. If it doesn't save time, we stop. But based on Meredith Noble's methodology (used by thousands), it will work."

### 5. DEMO TIPS

**DO:**
- Lead with business value (time, money, quality)
- Show specific examples from our work (BBRSDA, etc.)
- Be confident—this is based on proven methodology
- Have numbers ready (37 hours saved, 85% capacity increase)
- Emphasize scalability and team consistency
- Talk about competitive advantage

**DON'T:**
- Get too technical about Claude Code itself
- Show every single file (focus on impact)
- Apologize for using AI (this is professional tooling)
- Oversell—let the system speak for itself
- Rush through the demo
- Forget to ask for approval to proceed

### 6. CLOSING STATEMENT

"This system transforms grant writing from an art that depends on individual expertise into a systematic, teachable, scalable process. It's built on Meredith Noble's methodology—the industry standard—but enhanced with automation.

The investment is minimal: a $20/month subscription and 20 hours of setup. The return is massive: 740 hours of capacity annually, better quality, happier clients, and a competitive advantage in the market.

I recommend we:
1. Approve a 2-project pilot (Weeks 1-3)
2. Measure results against traditional methods
3. Roll out to full team (Weeks 4-8) if successful

Can I get your approval to start the pilot?"
